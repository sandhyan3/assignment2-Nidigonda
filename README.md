# Games on arbitrary graphs
 
 Let a game be played by two players on an arbitrary graph G. I.e. the current state of the game is a certain vertex. The players perform moves by turns, and move from the current vertex to an adjacent vertex using a connecting edge. Depending on the game, the person that is unable to move will either lose or win the game.
 
 vector<vector<int>> adj_rev;

vector<bool> winning;
vector<bool> losing;
vector<bool> visited;
vector<int> degree;

void dfs(int v) {
    visited[v] = true;
    for (int u : adj_rev[v]) {
        if (!visited[u]) {
            if (losing[v])
                winning[u] = true;
            else if (--degree[u] == 0)
                losing[u] = true;
            else
                continue;
            dfs(u);
        }
    }
}
